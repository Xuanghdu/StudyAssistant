## Online Education Ideas

### Study

Rewrite from [this webpage](https://www.chegg.com/study-101/how-to-improve-your-online-learning-experience/)

* Highlight important due dates: discussions, tests, assignments
* Colour codes for various classes
* Set reminders & notifications (e.g. at the beginning of each week)
* Synchronize with hand-written notebooks (handwriting helps retain knowledge)
* Redirect to a computer folder for each online course, separate folder for each week
* Links to the online platforms
* Favorite workspace: smart suggestion/reminder given your location
* Ask questions to your instructors and TAs
* Connect with classmates: course platform, Facebook, Google Docs
* Apply newly learned concepts by practice: study group with friends
* Review notes, connect new knowledge to prior knowledge

### Health

* Regular breaks (e.g. every 50 minutes)
* Online study rooms in which students see each other
